A note about names
==================

The terms "MOUL" and "MOULa" can be ambiguous,
because in some contexts they don't refer to just one version of the game,
but also include all later iterations based on that version.
For example,
MOUL, MOULa, and Gehn are three different Uru versions/shards,
but one might also say that MOULa is a MOUL shard or that Gehn is a MOULa shard.
In this documentation,
I try to avoid this ambiguity where the difference is relevant
(e. g. "Cyan's MOULa shard" vs. "MOULa-based shards").
If I don't specify which one I mean,
assume that I mean "that version or later".

Confusingly,
the MOULa game engine is also known under two names:
Plasma and CWE.
Different versions of the Plasma engine are used in a number of Cyan games,
including all Uru games (offline and online).
The specific Plasma version used in MOULa has been open-sourced by Cyan under the name "CyanWorlds.com Engine" (CWE),
but it is still referred to as "Plasma" in many cases
(even inside its own code).

For a detailed explanation of the different game and engine versions,
see the Guild of Writers wiki pages about `Uru <https://www.guildofwriters.org/wiki/Uru>`__ and `Plasma <https://www.guildofwriters.org/wiki/Plasma>`__.
