Game server
===========

Provides communication within a single age instance
by relaying Plasma messages over the network.

.. index:: game manager
   single: GameMgr
   :name: game_manager

The game server also provides the "game manager" (GameMgr),
a different mechanism used for some multiplayer activities,
like Ayoheek, marker games, and the hood garden age puzzle.
To reduce complexity of the server side,
the H'uru client has moved away from using the game manager
and the DIRTSAND server has never implemented it.
The OpenUru client continues to use the game manager
and the necessary server support is implemented in MOSS and Cyan's server software.

There can theoretically be multiple game server instances,
but in practice all MOULa servers use a single game server for all age instances.
