MOUL internals
==============

Assorted documentation about the internals of MOUL itself,
focusing especially on the network protocol and related aspects.

.. seealso::
   
   The `Guild of Writers <https://www.guildofwriters.org/wiki/>`__ and `OpenUru <https://wiki.openuru.org/>`__ wikis.
   Most of the information there focuses on age creation and server administration,
   but especially the GoW wiki has `some high-level docs <https://www.guildofwriters.org/wiki/Plasma>`__ about the :ref:`Plasma <plasma>` engine and its architecture.
