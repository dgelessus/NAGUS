NAGUS --- not a good Uru server
===============================

This is NAGUS, an Uru Live server that is not very good.

I'm trying to document not just the server implementation,
but also Uru's network protocol and architecture in general,
for which there is currently not much documentation.
But please be aware that I actually don't know a lot about Uru's architecture ---
most of this is written while I'm still figuring it out myself,
so expect mistakes!
I'll try to fix the code and docs if I notice that I got something wrong.
